# Cursor Rules for Words on Phone

- Every change must start with a failing Vitest or Cypress test.
- PRs must be â‰¤ 200 lines of code (excluding tests/docs).
- Commit only when all tests are green.
- PR template must confirm: npm run test && npx cypress run pass.
- Use vertical slices: UI, logic, tests, docs in one PR. 
- Before implementing any gameplay changes, consult docs/ruleset.md to ensure compatibility with core game mechanics (7-point scoring, hot-potato passing, timer-based rounds, clue-giving restrictions). If a change conflicts with established rules or introduces new gameplay elements, request user confirmation and clarify how it fits within the ruleset framework.
