# PhraseMachine v2 - "Description-Only Edition"

**Branch Name**: `feature/phrasemachine-v2-description-only`

## Background and Motivation

**Goal**: Build PhraseMachine v2 – an automated service that generates & vets 2-4-word phrases optimized for verbal description in 60-second party-game rounds. This represents a major evolution from the current generation system, focusing on phrases that are distinct things or idioms, instantly recognizable, family-friendly, and specifically optimized for verbal gameplay.

**Key Innovation**: Move beyond simple phrase generation to a comprehensive scoring system that evaluates distinctiveness (via Wikidata/Wikipedia matching), describability (concreteness ratings, proper noun detection), and cultural validation. The system will replace guesswork with data-driven quality assessment.

**Success Metrics**:
- <300ms average scoring latency per phrase
- >80% of auto-accepted phrases rated "easy to describe" by test panel  
- <5% false-positive rate for "non-thing" phrases in 1k-phrase sample
- Manual-review queue <20% of total generated phrases

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Technical Complexity**: Integration of multiple data sources (Wikidata, Google Books N-gram, Brysbaert concreteness norms) with real-time scoring pipeline requires careful architecture design and performance optimization.

**Data Engineering**: Processing Wikidata dumps, Google Books 2-4-gram datasets, and academic linguistic resources into queryable formats while maintaining <300ms response times.

**Scoring Algorithm**: Balancing 6 different scoring components (distinctiveness, describability, legacy heuristics, category boost, cultural validation) with appropriate weights and thresholds.

**Quality Assurance**: Building admin dashboard for manual review of borderline cases while maintaining high throughput for auto-accepted content.

- Created main API server orchestrating all 6 microservices with unified endpoints for complete phrase generation and scoring workflows
- Built ServiceDiscovery class with automatic health monitoring, failover capabilities, and event-driven status updates for all services
- Developed production-ready Docker Compose configuration with multi-service orchestration, health checks, and resource management
- Implemented comprehensive integration tests covering individual services, decision engine integration, LLM generation, and complete workflows
- Established service registry with automatic registration, deregistration, health tracking, and performance metrics collection

**Success Criteria Verification:**
- ✅ Main API server - Complete orchestration with unified endpoints (evaluate-and-generate, score-phrases, generate-diverse-batch, health, capabilities, stats, test)
- ✅ Service discovery - Automatic registration, continuous health monitoring (30s intervals), failover capabilities, and event-driven updates
- ✅ Production Docker - Multi-service orchestration with proper dependency management, health checks, resource limits, and security best practices
- ✅ Integration testing - Comprehensive system workflow validation with 80+ test cases covering service interactions, performance, and error handling

**Technical Implementation:**
- Main API Endpoints: Complete workflow (evaluate-and-generate), unified scoring (score-phrases), diverse generation (generate-diverse-batch), system monitoring (health/stats/capabilities/test)
- Service Discovery: Automatic registration for 6 microservices, health monitoring with response time thresholds (1s/3s/5s), consecutive failure tracking, recovery detection
- Docker Configuration: 10 services (Redis, PostgreSQL, 6 microservices, main API, Nginx) with health checks, resource management, networking isolation
- Integration Tests: Service health validation, individual functionality testing, decision engine integration, LLM generation workflow, performance testing, error handling
- Service Architecture: Complete microservices mesh (Distinctiveness 3004, Describability 3005, Legacy 3006, Cultural 3007, Decision Engine 3008, LLM Generator 3009, Main API 3000)
- Performance Monitoring: Service metrics, health percentage tracking, uptime monitoring, request statistics, response time analysis

**Ready for Task 13:** PostgreSQL Integration - Complete microservices architecture operational with unified API orchestration and service discovery.

```

**Scoring Algorithm Implementation**:
- **Distinctiveness** (0-25): Wikidata exact match → Wikipedia redirect → PMI ≥4 → WordNet MWE
- **Describability** (0-25): Concreteness bands + proper noun bonus - weak-head penalty  
- **Legacy Heuristics** (0-30): Existing word simplicity + length bonus
- **Category Boost** (0-10): Pop-culture/food/sports categories
- **Cultural Validation** (0-10): Reddit upvotes + language-count bonus
- **Decision Thresholds**: ≥75 auto-accept, 55-74 manual review, <55 reject

**Performance Requirements**:
- <300ms average scoring latency
- 100+ concurrent request handling
- Redis O(1) lookups for 50M+ entities
- PostgreSQL optimization for phrase history
