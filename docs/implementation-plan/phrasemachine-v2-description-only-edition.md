# PhraseMachine v2 - "Description-Only Edition"

**Branch Name**: `feature/phrasemachine-v2-description-only`

## Background and Motivation

**Goal**: Build PhraseMachine v2 – an automated service that generates & vets 2-4-word phrases optimized for verbal description in 60-second party-game rounds. This represents a major evolution from the current generation system, focusing on phrases that are distinct things or idioms, instantly recognizable, family-friendly, and specifically optimized for verbal gameplay.

**Key Innovation**: Move beyond simple phrase generation to a comprehensive scoring system that evaluates distinctiveness (via Wikidata/Wikipedia matching), describability (concreteness ratings, proper noun detection), and cultural validation. The system will replace guesswork with data-driven quality assessment.

**Success Metrics**:
- <300ms average scoring latency per phrase
- >80% of auto-accepted phrases rated "easy to describe" by test panel  
- <5% false-positive rate for "non-thing" phrases in 1k-phrase sample
- Manual-review queue <20% of total generated phrases

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Technical Complexity**: Integration of multiple data sources (Wikidata, Google Books N-gram, Brysbaert concreteness norms) with real-time scoring pipeline requires careful architecture design and performance optimization.

**Data Engineering**: Processing Wikidata dumps, Google Books 2-4-gram datasets, and academic linguistic resources into queryable formats while maintaining <300ms response times.

**Scoring Algorithm**: Balancing 6 different scoring components (distinctiveness, describability, legacy heuristics, category boost, cultural validation) with appropriate weights and thresholds.

**Quality Assurance**: Building admin dashboard for manual review of borderline cases while maintaining high throughput for auto-accepted content.
