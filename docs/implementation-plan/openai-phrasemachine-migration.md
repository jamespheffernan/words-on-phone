# OpenAI PhraseMachine Migration Plan

**Branch Name:** `feat/openai-phrasemachine-migration`

---

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to rebuild the AI phrase generation feature to leverage OpenAI's API instead of the current Gemini implementation. The migration will use:
- **OpenAI's GPT-4.1 nano model** (cost-efficient model)
- **Custom PhraseMachine prompt** from `docs/textForGPTprompt.txt` 
- **JSON-based response format** with structured schema
- **Batch generation** of 20-100 phrases per API call

**Key Requirements:**
- Use the exact prompt format provided in `textForGPTprompt.txt`
- Implement proper UUID generation for phrase IDs
- Support both topic-specific and general phrase generation
- Handle difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- Ensure family-friendly content generation
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing game features

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **API Migration Complexity**:
   - Different request/response formats between Gemini and OpenAI
   - Need to update serverless function, service layer, and worker
   - Must maintain secure API key handling through Netlify functions

2. **Prompt Format Changes**:
   - New prompt uses structured JSON schema with CustomTerm interface
   - Requires UUID generation for each phrase
   - Supports optional difficulty levels not in current implementation

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - New format supports 1-100 phrases per call (vs current 30-50)
   - Need to optimize API calls for cost efficiency
   - Consider implementing request batching for custom categories

4. **Error Handling**:
   - New format has specific error response structure
   - Need to handle both successful JSON arrays and error objects
   - Must gracefully handle API failures and rate limits

5. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Existing phrases in IndexedDB use different ID format
   - Need to maintain compatibility with current game flow
   - Custom categories should continue working seamlessly

## Implementation Details

### API Request Format
```typescript
interface OpenAIRequest {
  prompt: string; // Full prompt from textForGPTprompt.txt
  topic?: string; // Optional topic/category
  batchSize: number; // 1-100 phrases
  phraseIds: string[]; // Pre-generated UUIDs
}
```

### API Response Format
```typescript
// Success response
type SuccessResponse = CustomTerm[];

interface CustomTerm {
  id: string; // UUID echoed from request
  topic?: string; // Optional topic echoed back
  phrase: string; // 1-4 words, Title-case
  difficulty?: "easy" | "medium" | "hard"; // Optional
}

// Error response
interface ErrorResponse {
  error: string; // Short error reason
}

type OpenAIResponse = SuccessResponse | ErrorResponse;
```

### UUID Generation Strategy
- Use crypto.randomUUID() for browser environments
- Fallback to custom UUID v4 implementation for older browsers
- Pre-generate UUIDs client-side and send to API
- API echoes back the same UUIDs in response

### Cost Optimization
- Batch requests: 50-100 phrases per API call
- Cache responses aggressively in IndexedDB
- Implement daily/hourly rate limits
- Track API usage in Firebase Analytics
- Use GPT-4.1 nano for cost efficiency

- **Task 6**: Final Integration & Production Deployment ✅

### ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED: Service Layer Now Uses Dynamic AI Service Detection (2025-01-27)**

**Problem Identified:**
- UI correctly detected and displayed "Powered by OpenAI GPT-4.1 nano"
- `detectActiveAIService()` function correctly identified OpenAI as the active service
- **BUT**: CategoryRequestService was hardcoded to always use Gemini endpoint
- Service layer ignored detection logic and always called `GEMINI_API_URL`

**Root Cause:**
- Service was never updated to dynamically choose between OpenAI/Gemini
- Detection logic existed but wasn't used by the actual service layer
- Functions were deployed, but service didn't switch to preferred provider

**✅ FIX IMPLEMENTED:**
- ✅ Updated CategoryRequestService to use `detectActiveAIService()`
- ✅ Implemented dynamic endpoint and request format selection
- ✅ Added separate methods: `requestSampleWordsFromOpenAI()` and `requestSampleWordsFromGemini()`
- ✅ Added separate methods: `generatePhrasesFromOpenAI()` and `generatePhrasesFromGemini()`
- ✅ Updated response parsing to handle both OpenAI CustomTerm format and Gemini response format
- ✅ Added difficulty level support for OpenAI responses
- ✅ Removed deprecated `callGemini()` method
- ✅ UUID generation added for OpenAI requests
- ✅ TypeScript compilation verified with no errors

**🎉 RESULT: CategoryRequestService now actually uses OpenAI when available!**

### ✅ **TIMEOUT ISSUE RESOLVED: Reduced Batch Size to Prevent 502 Errors (2025-01-27)**

**🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED:**
- CategoryRequestService was requesting 50 phrases per batch
- Netlify functions have 10-second timeout limit
- Large batches caused: `{"errorType":"Sandbox.Timedout","errorMessage":"Task timed out after 10.00 seconds"}`
- User experienced: `OpenAI API error: 502`

**✅ FIX IMPLEMENTED:**
- ✅ Reduced `PHRASES_PER_CATEGORY` from 50 to 15
- ✅ Tested: 50 phrases = timeout, 15 phrases = success
- ✅ 15-phrase batches complete reliably within 10s limit
- ✅ Deployed to production and verified working

**🎯 RESULT: OpenAI category generation now works without 502 errors!**

### 🎯 **Technical Achievement Summary:**
- **Zero Downtime**: Gemini function remains operational during transition
- **Clean Deployment**: All TypeScript compilation successful
- **Production Ready**: OpenAI function deployed and responding correctly
- **Environment Isolation**: Proper separation between dev/prod configurations
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

**The OpenAI PhraseMachine migration is technically complete and ready for production use once the API key is configured!** 🎉
