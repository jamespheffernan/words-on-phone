# OpenAI PhraseMachine Migration Plan

**Branch Name:** `feat/openai-phrasemachine-migration`

---

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to rebuild the AI phrase generation feature to leverage OpenAI's API instead of the current Gemini implementation. The migration will use:
- **OpenAI's GPT-4.1 nano model** (cost-efficient model)
- **Custom PhraseMachine prompt** from `docs/textForGPTprompt.txt` 
- **JSON-based response format** with structured schema
- **Batch generation** of 20-100 phrases per API call

**Key Requirements:**
- Use the exact prompt format provided in `textForGPTprompt.txt`
- Implement proper UUID generation for phrase IDs
- Support both topic-specific and general phrase generation
- Handle difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- Ensure family-friendly content generation
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing game features

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **API Migration Complexity**:
   - Different request/response formats between Gemini and OpenAI
   - Need to update serverless function, service layer, and worker
   - Must maintain secure API key handling through Netlify functions

2. **Prompt Format Changes**:
   - New prompt uses structured JSON schema with CustomTerm interface
   - Requires UUID generation for each phrase
   - Supports optional difficulty levels not in current implementation

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - New format supports 1-100 phrases per call (vs current 30-50)
   - Need to optimize API calls for cost efficiency
   - Consider implementing request batching for custom categories

4. **Error Handling**:
   - New format has specific error response structure
   - Need to handle both successful JSON arrays and error objects
   - Must gracefully handle API failures and rate limits

5. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Existing phrases in IndexedDB use different ID format
   - Need to maintain compatibility with current game flow
   - Custom categories should continue working seamlessly

## Implementation Details

### API Request Format
```typescript
interface OpenAIRequest {
  prompt: string; // Full prompt from textForGPTprompt.txt
  topic?: string; // Optional topic/category
  batchSize: number; // 1-100 phrases
  phraseIds: string[]; // Pre-generated UUIDs
}
```

### API Response Format
```typescript
// Success response
type SuccessResponse = CustomTerm[];

interface CustomTerm {
  id: string; // UUID echoed from request
  topic?: string; // Optional topic echoed back
  phrase: string; // 1-4 words, Title-case
  difficulty?: "easy" | "medium" | "hard"; // Optional
}

// Error response
interface ErrorResponse {
  error: string; // Short error reason
}

type OpenAIResponse = SuccessResponse | ErrorResponse;
```

### UUID Generation Strategy
- Use crypto.randomUUID() for browser environments
- Fallback to custom UUID v4 implementation for older browsers
- Pre-generate UUIDs client-side and send to API
- API echoes back the same UUIDs in response

### Cost Optimization
- Batch requests: 50-100 phrases per API call
- Cache responses aggressively in IndexedDB
- Implement daily/hourly rate limits
- Track API usage in Firebase Analytics
- Use GPT-4.1 nano for cost efficiency
