# Words on Phone – Roadmap (9 Phases + Enhanced Features)

**Branch Name:** `feature/8-week-roadmap`

---

## Background and Motivation

Words on Phone is a mobile-first party game inspired by the classic "catch-phrase" mechanics.  The objective of this roadmap is to deliver a production-ready, offline-capable Progressive Web App (PWA) through **eight logical development phases**, wrapping it with Capacitor for iOS distribution.  This document replaces the original outline by adding a configurable **skip-limit** feature and clarifying phase deliverables, success criteria, and risk mitigation.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. Accurate, low-latency timer and buzzer that work in PWAs and Capacitor WebViews.
2. Managing OpenAI API usage limits and cost while keeping gameplay fresh.
3. Ensuring IndexedDB reliability across browser upgrades.
4. Implementing an **optional skip-limit** that:
   - Persists per-round state.
   - Resets upon a correct answer.
   - Can be configured (0 = unlimited, 1-5 = fixed cap).
   - Provides real-time UI feedback and analytics.
5. Solo-developer bandwidth: keep tasks small and test-driven.
6. **Custom category request system** that:
   - Allows users to request specific categories via OpenAI API.
   - Shows 1-2 sample words for confirmation before bulk fetching.
   - Generates 50+ quality phrases per requested category.
   - Maintains cost efficiency and API usage limits.
7. **Enhanced timer UX** that:
   - Randomizes timer duration by default for unpredictability.
   - Hides timer display by default to reduce anxiety.
   - Provides settings to show timer and set specific durations as options.

  - [x] Add visual distinction for custom categories with golden styling and ✨ emoji
  - [x] Update phrase service to organize custom phrases by category for efficient lookup
  - [x] Ensure custom categories appear in category selection grid after generation
  - [x] Add explanatory note for users about custom category indicators

**Success criteria**
1. All API calls successfully use Gemini API instead of OpenAI ✅
2. API key is stored and retrieved securely using localStorage ✅
3. Phrase generation and category requests work with Gemini ✅
4. Error messages and logging reference Gemini appropriately ✅
5. No references to OpenAI remain in the active codebase ✅

**Custom Category Integration Verified:** Custom categories now appear in the category selection grid with distinctive golden styling and sparkle emoji, making them easily identifiable from static categories.

**Phase 8D Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Gemini API Migration

All tasks completed successfully:
1. ✅ OpenAI to Gemini API Migration - phrase worker fully migrated
2. ✅ Category Request Service Migration - service migrated with proper API calls  
3. ✅ API Key Management & Security - secure key storage implemented
4. ✅ Interface & Type Updates - all interfaces updated consistently
5. ✅ Custom Category Display Integration - custom categories now appear in category selection grid with distinctive golden styling and sparkle emoji

**API Integration Verified:** Direct API test confirms Gemini endpoint responds correctly with generated phrases matching expected format.

**GEMINI API MIGRATION BUG FIX (2025-01-27):** 🐛➡️✅ Fixed critical category request bug where the `generateRequestId` method was using timestamps, causing request IDs to be different between `requestSampleWords` and `generateFullCategory` calls. The issue was that the ID generation included `Date.now()`, so the same category name would generate different IDs at different times, causing "Category request not found" errors.

**Solution Applied:**
- Modified `generateRequestId` to be deterministic based only on category name (removed timestamp)
- Updated `generateFullCategory` to handle missing requests gracefully by creating new ones if needed
- This ensures consistent request IDs and robust category request handling

**Technical Details:**
- Before: `req_${categoryName}_${Date.now()}` (non-deterministic)
- After: `req_${categoryName}` (deterministic)
- Added fallback logic to create missing requests automatically
- Category request flow now works reliably end-to-end

All Phase 8D success criteria remain met ✅. Category request system fully operational with Gemini API.
