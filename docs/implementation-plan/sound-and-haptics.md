# Sound Effects and Haptic Feedback Implementation Plan

Branch Name: `feature/sound-and-haptics`

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to add:
1. Sound functionality throughout the app
2. Haptic feedback on mobile devices

Current state:
- Only buzzer sound at timer end
- Basic beep ramp system
- Minimal haptic feedback (only on timer end)
- No UI interaction sounds

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Sound Design**: Creating cohesive, non-annoying sound effects
2. **Performance**: Ensuring sounds don't impact game performance
3. **Haptics API**: Different APIs for iOS vs Android
4. **User Control**: Allowing users to customize sound/haptic preferences
5. **Accessibility**: Ensuring sounds enhance rather than hinder

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create feature branch
**Success Criteria**: 
- Create and checkout `feature/sound-and-haptics` branch
- Verify clean git status

### Task 2: Design comprehensive sound system
**Success Criteria**:
- Create sound categories (UI, gameplay, alerts)
- Define sound trigger points
- Establish volume levels and mixing
- Document sound design principles

### Task 3: Source/create sound effects
**Success Criteria**:
- Button tap sounds (subtle clicks)
- Correct answer chime
- Skip/pass swoosh
- Team transition fanfare
- Menu navigation sounds
- Error/invalid action sounds
- Victory celebration sound

### Task 4: Implement sound effect service
**Success Criteria**:
- Centralized sound management
- Preloading for instant playback
- Volume control per sound type
- Sound pooling for performance
- Fallback for failed loads

### Task 5: Add haptic feedback system
**Success Criteria**:
- Light tap for button presses
- Success vibration pattern
- Error/invalid vibration
- Timer warning haptics
- Team transition haptic
- Platform-specific implementation

### Task 6: Create sound/haptic settings panel
**Success Criteria**:
- Master volume control
- Individual sound toggles
- Haptic intensity slider
- Preview buttons
- Preset profiles (subtle/normal/intense)

### Task 7: Implement contextual audio
**Success Criteria**:
- Background ambient during menu
- Tension building during low time
- Audio ducking for important sounds
- Smooth transitions between states

### Task 8: Add gesture-based haptics
**Success Criteria**:
- Swipe feedback
- Long press confirmation
- Drag/drop sensations
- Pull-to-refresh haptic

### Task 9: Optimize for battery/performance
**Success Criteria**:
- Efficient audio loading
- Haptic throttling
- Battery usage monitoring
- Low-power mode detection
- Performance profiling

### Task 10: Create comprehensive tests
**Success Criteria**:
- Test all sound triggers
- Test haptic patterns
- Test settings persistence
- Test performance impact
- Test accessibility
