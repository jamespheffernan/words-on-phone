# Sound Effects and Haptic Feedback Implementation Plan

Branch Name: `feature/sound-and-haptics`

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to add:
1. Sound functionality throughout the app
2. Haptic feedback on mobile devices

Current state:
- Only buzzer sound at timer end
- Basic beep ramp system
- Minimal haptic feedback (only on timer end)
- No UI interaction sounds

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Sound Design**: Creating cohesive, non-annoying sound effects
2. **Performance**: Ensuring sounds don't impact game performance
3. **Haptics API**: Different APIs for iOS vs Android

## Planner Assessment & Strategy

**[2025-06-22] PLANNER REVIEW - SOUND AND HAPTICS ENHANCEMENT**

### üéØ **Strategic Priority**
This is a **high-impact, user-experience enhancement** that will significantly improve game engagement and mobile app feel. Sound and haptics are essential for modern mobile games and will help differentiate Words on Phone from basic web apps.

### üìä **Current Audio State Analysis**
**Existing Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Basic Web Audio API integration in `useAudio.ts`
- ‚úÖ Buzzer sound at timer end
- ‚úÖ Accelerating beep system (hot potato effect)
- ‚úÖ Basic Capacitor haptics (`@capacitor/haptics`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Gaps**: No UI interaction sounds, limited haptic patterns, no user controls

### üé® **Design Philosophy**
**Sound Design Principles:**
1. **Subtle but Satisfying** - Enhance without overwhelming
2. **Contextual Feedback** - Different sounds for different actions
3. **User Control** - Full customization and disable options
4. **Performance First** - Zero impact on gameplay timing
5. **Accessibility** - Visual alternatives for audio cues

### üîß **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1: Core Audio Enhancement (Tasks 1-4)**
- Leverage existing `useAudio` hook architecture
- Extend current Web Audio API implementation
- Add sound effect library management
- Focus on gameplay sounds first

**Phase 2: Haptic Integration (Tasks 5-6)**
- Build on existing Capacitor haptics
- Add contextual vibration patterns
- Create user preference system
- iOS/Android platform optimization

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Tasks 7-10)**
- Ambient audio and transitions
- Gesture-based feedback
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing

### ‚ö° **Quick Wins Identified**
1. **Button Tap Sounds** - Easy to implement, immediate UX improvement
2. **Success/Error Chimes** - Clear feedback for user actions
3. **Haptic Settings Panel** - Leverage existing settings architecture
4. **Volume Controls** - Extend current buzzer volume system

### üéØ **Success Metrics**
- User engagement increase (longer session times)
- Positive feedback on "game feel"
- No performance degradation
- Accessibility compliance maintained
- Battery impact < 5% increase

**Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation focusing on core gameplay sounds first, then expand to full haptic system.
