# Phrase Database Generation - Rebuild to 1000+ High-Quality Phrases

## Background and Motivation

Following the successful completion of the phrase quality upgrade initiative, we now have a comprehensive phrase generation and quality validation system. The recent database cleaning removed 88.4% of phrases (from 1,491 to 173), eliminating inappropriate content and low-quality phrases. 

**Current State:**
- 173 high-quality phrases remaining (40+ points)
- Comprehensive quality scoring system (0-100 points)
- Enhanced prompts with party game context
- Manual review interface for quality control
- Production-ready generation infrastructure

**Goal:** Rebuild the database to 1000+ high-quality phrases across diverse categories, with an eventual target of 10,000+ phrases.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Scale Requirements**: Need to generate 827+ new phrases to reach 1000 total
2. **Quality Consistency**: Maintain 40+ point quality threshold across all generated content
3. **Category Distribution**: Ensure balanced representation across all game categories
4. **Batch Processing**: Work within Netlify function timeout limits (10 seconds)
5. **Manual Review**: Balance automation with human quality control
6. **Performance**: Maintain generation speed while ensuring quality
7. **Infrastructure Integration**: We have THREE separate systems that need coordination:
   - **Phrase Database Builder Tool** (SQLite-based with full CLI)
   - **Production phraseService** (uses IndexedDB and Netlify functions)
   - **Batch generator script** (currently mocked, needs real implementation)

## Revised Strategy and Approach

### Infrastructure Analysis
After reviewing our systems, we have:
1. **Production-ready phrase database tool** in `tools/phrase-database/` with:
   - SQLite database with proper schema
   - Quality scoring system (matches our 0-100 scale)
   - Duplicate detection
   - Category quota management
   - CLI with 15+ commands
   - Export functionality to game format

2. **Production AI generation** via:
   - Gemini 2.5 Flash (primary) with enhanced reasoning
   - OpenAI (fallback) 
   - Both limited to 15 phrases per request (timeout constraints)

3. **Quality validation** systems:
   - PhraseScorer service (0-100 scoring)
   - Wikipedia/Reddit validation
   - Manual review interface

### Recommended Approach
Instead of building new infrastructure, we should:
1. Use the phrase database tool as our primary generation workspace
2. Generate phrases via the production Netlify functions
3. Import and score in the database tool
4. Export clean JSON for production

This avoids duplicating infrastructure and leverages tested systems.

## Project Status Board

### 🟢 Ready to Start
- Task 3: Setup Database Tool and Integration

### 🚧 In Progress
- Task 1: Create Feature Branch and Setup (analyzing current state)

### ✅ Completed
- Task 2: Design Generation Strategy (category distribution, batch workflow, quality control, monitoring system, integration architecture)

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Phase**: Setup and Strategy Design
**Progress**: 2/8 tasks complete (25%)
**Target**: 1000+ high-quality phrases
**Current Database**: 173 phrases (40+ points)
**Strategy**: Leverage existing phrase database tool + production APIs

## Quality Standards Reference

### Scoring System (0-100 points)
- **80-100**: Auto-accept (clearly recognizable)
- **60-79**: Accept (good for gameplay) 
- **40-59**: Manual review suggested
- **20-39**: Warning (likely too obscure)
- **0-19**: Auto-reject (too technical)

### Enhanced Prompting Strategy
Based on our production prompts, emphasize:
1. **Simple, recognizable phrases** (2-4 words)
2. **Pop culture relevance** 
3. **Acting/guessing friendly**
4. **Avoid**: Technical jargon, offensive content, niche references

### Category Balance Targets
Aiming for relatively even distribution with slight emphasis on popular categories:
- **Core Categories** (100 each): Movies, Music, Sports, Food
- **Secondary** (80-100 each): Places, People, Entertainment  
- **Specialized** (60-80 each): Tech, History, Nature
- **Variety** (80-100 each): Everything, Everything+

This ensures no category dominates while popular categories have sufficient content.

### Quality Control Workflow
1. **Generate**: 15 phrases per API call
2. **Score**: Use phraseScorer (0-100)
3. **Auto-Filter**: 
   - Accept: 60+ scores
   - Review: 40-59 scores
   - Reject: <40 scores
4. **Manual Review**: Check 40-59 range for hidden gems
5. **Import**: Add accepted phrases to database
6. **Track**: Monitor category quotas and quality metrics

**Total Target**: 1,073 phrases (excluding Entertainment reduction)
**Net New**: ~900 phrases needed
**Total Batches**: ~60 batches at 15 phrases each

### Batch Generation Workflow ✅

**Step 1: Generate (via Production API)**
- Call Netlify function: `/.netlify/functions/gemini` (primary) or `/openai` (fallback)
- Request 15 phrases per batch (proven timeout limit)
- Use category-specific prompts with party game context
- Expected success rate: 60-80% quality phrases per batch

**Step 2: Score & Filter (Automatic)**
- Use PhraseScorer service (0-100 scale)
- Apply filters:
  - **Auto-Accept**: Score ≥ 60 (good for gameplay)
  - **Review Queue**: Score 40-59 (manual review needed)
  - **Auto-Reject**: Score < 40 (too obscure/inappropriate)

**Step 3: Manual Review (for 40-59 scores)**
- Use existing phrase review interface
- Focus on party game suitability
- Accept hidden gems, reject borderline cases

**Step 4: Import to Database**
- Add accepted phrases to phrase database tool
- Automatic duplicate detection
- Category quota tracking
- Quality statistics logging

### Quality Control Process ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Excellent (80-100)**: Instantly recognizable, perfect for parties
- **Good (60-79)**: Solid gameplay phrases, auto-accept
- **Borderline (40-59)**: Manual review required
- **Poor (20-39)**: Likely too obscure, auto-reject
- **Terrible (0-19)**: Inappropriate/technical, auto-reject

**Review Guidelines:**
1. Can most people recognize this phrase?
2. Is it fun to act out or describe?
3. Appropriate for all ages/audiences?
4. Fits the category well?
5. Not too specific/technical?

**Quality Targets:**
- Average score per category: 65+ 
- Acceptance rate from AI: 50%+ (8+ phrases per 15-phrase batch)
- Manual review rate: <30% of generated phrases

### Progress Tracking System ✅

**Real-time Metrics:**
- Category completion percentage (target vs current)
- Quality score distribution per category
- Acceptance/rejection rates by batch
- API success rates (Gemini vs OpenAI)
- Manual review queue size

**Progress Dashboard Format:**
