# Team-Based Scoring System Implementation Plan

Branch Name: `feature/team-based-scoring`

## Background and Motivation

The current game has two conflicting scoring systems:
1. A live counter showing correct answers per round (irrelevant for team-based play)
2. An optional score tracker that isn't integrated with the game flow

According to the official rules in `docs/ruleset.md`, Words on Phone is a team-based hot-potato game where:
- Teams alternate holding the device
- The team NOT holding the device when the buzzer sounds scores 1 point
- First team to 7 points wins
- Optional house rule: +1 bonus point if the non-holding team can guess the visible phrase

The user wants to:
- Remove the individual correct answer counter
- Make team scoring the core game mechanic
- Add team names (with fun default options)
- Track fastest correct answer per round
- Show round statistics in a "which team won" screen

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **State Management**: Need to track which team is currently playing, team scores, and round statistics
2. **Hot Potato Mechanic**: Need to visually indicate team transitions and current active team
3. **Round Flow**: After buzzer, need to ask which team won (since app can't know who was holding device)
4. **Statistics Tracking**: Need to track phrase timing for "fastest answer" metric
5. **UI Design**: Need intuitive team setup, in-game team indicators, and post-round statistics

### User Feedback Fixes Completed (2024-12-XX)

- [2024-12-XX] **Fix Task 1 COMPLETE**: Resolved double-counting bug by removing duplicate `incrementTeamScore()` call from App.tsx. Teams now receive exactly 1 point per round win as `completeRound()` handles scoring internally.

- [2024-12-XX] **Fix Task 2 COMPLETE**: Implemented dynamic team rotation in `nextPhrase` action. The `currentTeamIndex` now updates after each correct answer to reflect hot-potato device passing mechanics. Teams can see who should be holding the device at any time.

- [2024-12-XX] **Fix Task 3 COMPLETE**: Enhanced RoundEndScreen with next round team pre-selection:
  - Added two-step process: first select winning team, then choose next round starter
  - Smart pre-selection based on current team rotation
  - Visual feedback with selected states for better UX
  - Continue button appears only after both selections are made

- [2024-12-XX] **Fix Task 4 COMPLETE**: Replaced confusing dice icon with obscured countdown display:
  - Created dynamic symbol-based countdown using decorative characters (â—‰, â—Ž, â—‹, etc.)
  - Symbols change and multiply based on time progression without revealing actual numbers
  - Maintains suspense while indicating countdown activity
  - Smooth animations with pulsing effects for visual appeal

- [2024-12-XX] **Fix Task 5 COMPLETE**: Applied comprehensive glassmorphism styling to TeamSetup component:
  - Full-screen overlay with gradient background matching other screens
  - Glassmorphism content container with backdrop blur and transparency
  - Responsive design with clamp() for mobile optimization
  - Enhanced VS indicator with circular glassmorphism design
  - Consistent button styling with hover effects and proper accessibility
  - Updated mobile responsive breakpoints for better UX

**All user feedback issues resolved successfully. Build passing. Ready for user testing and validation.**

## Team-Based Scoring Fixes

### User Feedback Issues Identified

The user has identified several critical issues with the current implementation that need immediate attention:

1. **Double-counting bug**: Teams get 2 points instead of 1 when they win a round
2. **Team rotation missing**: The "holding" indicator should update after each correct guess, not just at round start
3. **Unclear dice icon**: The ðŸŽ² icon in timer placeholder needs better explanation or removal
4. **Inconsistent styling**: TeamSetup component lacks the glassmorphism design of other screens

### Proposed Solutions

#### Fix 1: Resolve Double-Counting Bug
**Root Cause**: `App.tsx` calls both `incrementTeamScore()` and `completeRound()`, but `completeRound()` already increments the score internally.

**Solution**: Remove the `incrementTeamScore()` call from `App.tsx` and let `completeRound()` handle scoring exclusively.

**Files to modify**: 
- `src/App.tsx` - Remove duplicate score increment

#### Fix 2: Implement Dynamic Team Rotation  
**Root Cause**: `currentTeamIndex` only gets set during team setup but never updates during gameplay.

**Solution**: Update `currentTeamIndex` after each correct answer in the `nextPhrase` action to reflect device passing. Add "who's starting next round" pre-selection to RoundEndScreen.

**Files to modify**:
- `src/store.ts` - Add team rotation logic to `nextPhrase` action
- `src/components/RoundEndScreen.tsx` - Add "who's starting next round" selection with smart pre-selection

#### Fix 3: Clarify Timer Indicator
**Root Cause**: The ðŸŽ² dice icon is confusing without context.

**Solution**: Replace the dice icon with an obscured countdown using a decorative font (like Wingdings or Alien-style font) that shows countdown motion without revealing actual numbers. This maintains suspense while indicating time progression.

**Files to modify**:
- `src/components/GameScreen.tsx` - Implement obscured countdown display
- `src/components/GameScreen.css` - Add styling for decorative countdown font

#### Fix 4: Apply Consistent Styling to TeamSetup
**Root Cause**: TeamSetup component uses basic styling instead of the app's glassmorphism design system.

**Solution**: Update `TeamSetup.css` to match the visual design of other screens (MenuScreen, EndScreen, etc.).

**Files to modify**:
- `src/components/TeamSetup.css` - Apply glassmorphism styling, responsive design, and consistent color scheme

### Implementation Priority

1. **HIGH**: Fix double-counting bug (breaks core gameplay)
2. **HIGH**: Implement dynamic team rotation (essential for hot-potato mechanics)  
3. **MEDIUM**: Apply consistent styling to TeamSetup
4. **LOW**: Clarify timer indicator

### Success Criteria

- Teams receive exactly 1 point per round win
- "Holding" indicator accurately reflects current device holder throughout the round
- TeamSetup screen matches the visual design of other app screens
- Timer indicator is either self-explanatory or removed
- All existing Cypress tests continue to pass
- New tests added to verify fixed behaviors

### Estimated Effort

**Total**: 4-6 tasks, approximately 2-3 hours of implementation time

This represents a focused bug-fix and polish phase rather than new feature development.

**Next Steps**: Create PR via GitHub web interface and conduct manual testing of the team gameplay flow.
