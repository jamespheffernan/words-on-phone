# Category Selection UX Redesign Implementation Plan

Branch Name: `feature/category-selection-redesign`

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to redesign the category selection with these requirements:
1. Retain user-created categories (available to all users)
2. User categories not included in "Everything" by default
3. Easy multi-category selection
4. Live updating banner showing selected categories and total word count
5. Better organization (e.g., swipe to see user-created categories)

Current limitations:
- Single category selection only
- User categories mixed with default categories
- No indication of phrase count per category
- No way to combine multiple categories

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Data Architecture**: Need to separate default vs user-created categories
2. **Multi-Select UI**: Design intuitive multi-category selection
3. **Real-time Updates**: Calculate total phrase count across selected categories
4. **Storage**: Persist user category preferences and selections
5. **Performance**: Efficient deduplication when combining categories

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create feature branch
**Success Criteria**: 
- Create and checkout `feature/category-selection-redesign` branch
- Verify clean git status

### Task 2: Refactor category data structure
**Success Criteria**:
- Separate default and user categories in phraseService
- Add metadata (phrase count, creation date, creator)
- Update storage to maintain category separation
- Ensure backward compatibility

### Task 3: Design new CategorySelector component
**Success Criteria**:
- Tab or swipe navigation between default/user categories
- Checkbox UI for multi-selection
- Visual distinction between category types
- Search/filter functionality
- Responsive grid layout

### Task 4: Implement live selection banner
**Success Criteria**:
- Floating banner showing selected categories
- Real-time phrase count calculation
- Quick clear/select all buttons
- Smooth animations for add/remove
- Collapsible for more screen space

### Task 5: Add phrase count indicators
**Success Criteria**:
- Show phrase count on each category tile
- Update counts when categories are modified
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Loading states during calculation

### Task 6: Implement multi-category phrase loading
**Success Criteria**:
- Combine phrases from selected categories
- Efficient deduplication algorithm
- Maintain proper randomization
- Update PhraseCursor to handle merged sets

### Task 7: Add category management features
**Success Criteria**:

- Update tooltip/help text

### Task 9: Enhance user category creation
**Success Criteria**:
- Flag categories as user-created
- Optional category description
- Category tags/themes
- Share category via link/code

### Task 10: Add comprehensive tests
**Success Criteria**:
- Test multi-selection logic
- Test phrase count calculations
- Test category combination
- Test UI interactions
- Performance benchmarks

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**BLOCKER - File Corruption Issue**: During Task 2 implementation, encountered persistent corruption of `src/services/phraseService.ts` file when attempting to add the enhanced category metadata interfaces. The file gets truncated to only 23 lines instead of the original 324 lines after edits. Multiple restoration attempts (git checkout, git restore, git show) have failed to recover the complete file content.

**Request**: Need assistance to:
1. Properly restore the complete phraseService.ts file (324 lines)
2. Alternative approach to implement the category metadata enhancement without file corruption
3. Investigation into why the edit_file tool is corrupting this specific file

**Current Status**: Task 1 complete, Task 2 blocked due to file corruption issue.
