# Header Overlap Fix - Scoreboard and Skip Counter

## Background and Motivation

**Issue Identified**: In the new mobile gameplay UI, the scoreboard icon (score display) and skip counter overlap on certain screen sizes. This creates a poor user experience where important game information becomes unreadable.

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- The `.skip-counter` is positioned as a separate block element below `.game-header-controls`
- The score display is positioned at the end of `.game-header-controls` 
- On smaller screens, these elements can visually overlap or create layout conflicts
- The current CSS doesn't ensure proper spacing and hierarchy between these elements

**User Impact**: Players cannot clearly see their current score or remaining skips, which are critical gameplay elements.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Layout Hierarchy**: Need to reorganize header structure to prevent overlaps
2. **Responsive Design**: Ensure proper spacing across all mobile screen sizes
3. **Visual Clarity**: Maintain clear separation between score and skip information
4. **Touch Targets**: Preserve accessibility requirements for mobile interaction
5. **Existing Mobile Optimizations**: Must not break the recently implemented mobile viewport fixes

  - Test both portrait and landscape orientations
- **Success Criteria**:
  - No overlaps on any target device
  - All text remains readable
  - Touch targets remain accessible

### Task 6: Update Cypress Tests
- **Objective**: Add automated tests to prevent regression
- **Actions**:
  - Add header layout tests to mobile-viewport.cy.ts
  - Test for element positioning and overlap detection
  - Verify skip counter visibility when skip limit > 0
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Tests pass on all viewport sizes
  - Overlap detection works correctly
  - Skip counter visibility logic is tested

### Task 7: Documentation and Deployment
- **Objective**: Document fix and deploy to production
- **Actions**:
  - Update implementation plan with technical details
  - Commit changes with descriptive message
  - Merge to main and deploy
- **Success Criteria**:

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Task 2 Analysis - Current Layout Issues Identified

**Current Structure Problem:**
```jsx
<header className="game-header">  <!-- justify-content: space-between -->
  <div className="game-header-controls">  <!-- flex with gap -->
    <button>⏸️</button>
    <div>Timer/Placeholder</div>
    <div className="score-display">Score: X</div>
  </div>
  {skipLimit > 0 && (
    <div className="skip-counter">Skips left: X</div>  <!-- text-align: center -->
  )}
</header>
```

**Root Cause:**
- `.game-header` uses `justify-content: space-between` but only expects one child
- `.skip-counter` is positioned separately with `text-align: center`
- No guaranteed spacing between score display and skip counter
- On smaller screens (iPhone SE 375px), elements can visually overlap

**Specific Overlap Scenarios:**
- iPhone SE (375px): Score display and skip counter can overlap
- Landscape mode with short height: Vertical space is limited
- When timer is hidden: Layout shifts but spacing issues remain

### Task 3 Implementation - CSS Grid Layout Solution

**New Structure Implemented:**
```css
.game-header {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "controls"
    "skip-info";
  gap: clamp(8px, 2vw, 12px);
}

.game-header-controls {
  grid-area: controls;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.skip-counter {
  grid-area: skip-info;
  margin-top: clamp(4px, 1vw, 6px);
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Dedicated grid areas prevent overlap
- Responsive gap ensures proper spacing
- Skip counter has guaranteed space below controls
- All sizing uses clamp() for responsive scaling

### Task 6 Implementation - Comprehensive Test Coverage

**New Tests Added to mobile-viewport.cy.ts:**
- Header overlap detection on all mobile viewports (iPhone SE to iPhone 14 Pro Max)
- Landscape orientation overlap prevention tests
- Skip counter visibility state change testing
- Touch target size validation for accessibility
- Spacing verification (4px minimum on mobile, 2px in landscape)

**Test Coverage:**
- 5 mobile viewports × overlap detection = comprehensive coverage
- 3 landscape viewports × layout verification
- Dynamic skip counter state testing
- Touch accessibility validation
