# Phrase Pool Expansion – Roadmap to 5,000+ High-Quality Phrases

## Branch Name
`feature/phrase-pool-expansion`

---

## Background and Motivation

The game currently uses ~170 core phrases plus ~250 in-progress additions from the **phrase-database-generation** initiative. While the quality is now excellent thanks to the **phrase-quality-upgrade** project, quantity still limits replay value.  A sustainable pipeline is needed to scale the pool past **1 000 → 5 000+** phrases across all categories while preserving the rigorous quality standards already in place.

Key existing assets we will build upon:
1. Phrase Database Builder CLI (SQLite-backed, duplicate detection, exporter)
2. Production AI generation functions (**OpenAI primary**, Gemini fallback)
3. Comprehensive 0-100 scoring & validation pipeline (local heuristics, Wikidata, Reddit)
4. Manual Review Interface built into the React app

---

## Key Challenges and Analysis

| # | Challenge | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|
| 1 | **Throughput** | Generating ~4 800 net new accepted phrases at ~8 accepted/15-phrase batch ⇒ ~600 API batches. Must stay within OpenAI rate-limits (3 RPM / 200 RPD default) & Netlify 10 s timeout. |
| 2 | **Quality Consistency** | Maintain ≥60 average score with <10 % manual review rejects while scaling. |
| 3 | **Category Balance** | Prevent over-representation of entertainment categories; enforce quotas dynamically. |
| 4 | **Automation vs. Review** | Human review cannot keep pace at current UI speed; need bulk-approve for 80+ scores and smarter triage. |
| 5 | **Incremental Deployment** | Avoid giant single release; ship in weekly 500-phrase increments, monitoring game balance & performance. |
| 6 | **Observability** | Require dashboards/metrics to track generation rate, score distribution, duplicate trends, review backlog, **provider-level quality comparisons**. |
| 7 | **Provider Migration** | Ensure prompt templates and retry logic work with OpenAI as default; Gemini remains tested fallback. |
| 8 | **API Key Scaling** | Support configuring multiple OpenAI API keys for higher RPM/RPD if needed. |
