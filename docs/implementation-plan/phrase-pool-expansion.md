# Phrase Pool Expansion – Roadmap to 5,000+ High-Quality Phrases

## Branch Name
`feature/phrase-pool-expansion`

---

## Background and Motivation

The game currently uses ~170 core phrases plus ~250 in-progress additions from the **phrase-database-generation** initiative. While the quality is now excellent thanks to the **phrase-quality-upgrade** project, quantity still limits replay value.  A sustainable pipeline is needed to scale the pool past **1 000 → 5 000+** phrases across all categories while preserving the rigorous quality standards already in place.

Key existing assets we will build upon:
1. Phrase Database Builder CLI (SQLite-backed, duplicate detection, exporter)
2. Production AI generation functions (**OpenAI primary**, Gemini fallback)
3. Comprehensive 0-100 scoring & validation pipeline (local heuristics, Wikidata, Reddit)
4. Manual Review Interface built into the React app

---

## Key Challenges and Analysis

| # | Challenge | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|
| 1 | **Throughput** | Generating ~4 800 net new accepted phrases at ~8 accepted/15-phrase batch ⇒ ~600 API batches. Must stay within OpenAI rate-limits (3 RPM / 200 RPD default) & Netlify 10 s timeout. |
| 2 | **Quality Consistency** | Maintain ≥60 average score with <10 % manual review rejects while scaling. |
| 3 | **Category Balance** | Prevent over-representation of entertainment categories; enforce quotas dynamically. |
| 4 | **Automation vs. Review** | Human review cannot keep pace at current UI speed; need bulk-approve for 80+ scores and smarter triage. |
| 5 | **Incremental Deployment** | Avoid giant single release; ship in weekly 500-phrase increments, monitoring game balance & performance. |
| 6 | **Observability** | Require dashboards/metrics to track generation rate, score distribution, duplicate trends, review backlog, **provider-level quality comparisons**. |
| 7 | **Provider Migration** | Ensure prompt templates and retry logic work with OpenAI as default; Gemini remains tested fallback. |
| 8 | **API Key Scaling** | Support configuring multiple OpenAI API keys for higher RPM/RPD if needed. |
| 9 | **Duplicate Generation at Source** | AI generates 70-90% duplicates in saturated categories because enhanced prompts with "don't use" lists are built but never sent to the AI (critical bug in api-client.js). |

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Provider Switch Pre-Task ✅
- [x] Update environment configuration so `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present and used by default service layer
- [x] Modify `api-client.js` to attempt OpenAI first, Gemini as fallback
- [x] Validate prompts against GPT-4o and adjust temperature/max_tokens as needed
- **Success Criteria**: ✅ ALL MET - Generation CLI produces a 15-phrase batch via OpenAI in <10 s with ≥50 % acceptable phrases.

**Implementation Results:**
- ✅ OpenAI now primary service (was Gemini)
- ✅ Database schema updated with `source_provider` and `model_id` columns
- ✅ Quality pipeline includes provider attribution
- ✅ Analytics script created for provider comparison
- ✅ API client correctly handles OpenAI's direct array response format
- ✅ End-to-end test validates: connectivity, fallback order, attribution, storage
- ✅ All success criteria met: OpenAI primary, attribution recorded, migration complete, quality pipeline working, <10s processing

**Technical Notes:**
- OpenAI function returns direct array format: `[{id, phrase, topic, difficulty}]`
- Gemini remains functional fallback with existing JSON array parsing
- Database migration system handles schema upgrades gracefully
- Provider attribution enables quality comparison analytics

### Task 0 – Project Setup ✅
- [x] Create feature branch `feature/phrase-pool-expansion` off latest `main`
- [x] Link existing **phrase-database-generation** branch as dependency; coordinate merges
- [x] Create PROJECT-STATUS.md for milestone tracking
- [x] Push branch and create draft PR for progress tracking
- **Success Criteria**: ✅ Branch created; plan committed; scratchpad updated; PR created.

### Task 1 – Architecture Consolidation ✅
- [x] Map current data flow end-to-end (AI → scoring → DB → export → game import), **including provider & model attribution metadata**
- [x] Refactor/rename scripts for clarity (`generate-batch`, `process-batch`, `export-game-json`), ensure `sourceProvider` field propagates
- [x] Extract shared config (categories, score thresholds) into `/config`
- **Success Criteria**: ✅ ALL MET - Architecture diagram created, scripts refactored with clear naming, shared config implemented, CLI commands functional.

### Task 2 – Throughput & Automation Enhancements ✅
- [x] Add **batch-queue runner** that iterates categories until quota met, with optional round-robin across multiple OpenAI API keys
- [x] Implement **concurrent generation** (max 2 parallel batches) with rate-limit guard
- [x] Persist generation log (`data/generation-log.json`) for resume on crash
- **Success Criteria**: ✅ ALL MET - Tool can autonomously generate 150 phrases (~10 batches) in <20 min without manual supervision.

### Task 3 – Review Workflow Upgrade ✅
- [x] Extend scoring: auto-accept ≥70, auto-reject <40, queue 40-69
- [x] Build **bulk review dashboard** inside phrase review interface (keyboard shortcuts, batch approve)
- [x] Add CSV export/import option for crowdsourced review
- **Success Criteria**: ✅ ALL MET - Reviewer can process 300 queued phrases in ≤30 min; acceptance & rejection reflected in DB.

### Task 3b – Provider Attribution & Analytics
- [ ] Add `sourceProvider` TEXT and `modelId` TEXT columns to SQLite schema (e.g., provider "openai", modelId "gpt-4o-2025-06-13")
- [ ] Update `api-client.js` and CLI so each stored phrase records its provider **and exact model id**
- [ ] Extend `quality-pipeline.js` to log provider & model with scores
- [ ] Add analytics script `analyze-provider-quality.js` that outputs per-provider & per-model average score, acceptance rate, duplicate rate
- **Success Criteria**: After ≥3 mixed batches, analysis script outputs metrics split by provider and model id; DB migration retains existing data.

### Task 4 – Phase I Expansion to 2 000 Phrases
- [ ] Generate & review until each category hits **minimum 150 phrases** (target total ≈2 000)
- [ ] Run duplicate & obscenity scans; fix issues
- [ ] Export `phrases-v2.json`; integrate into game; run 10-round playtest
- **Success Criteria**: Game loads 2 000-phrase file; playtest shows no dupes/objectionable phrases; category counts correct.

### Task 5 – Continuous Generation Pipeline
- [ ] Add **GitHub Actions** (or Netlify scheduled function) nightly job: `npm run generate-nightly --max-batches 20`
- [ ] On success, open automated PR with new phrases & metrics
- [ ] Alert on failure or quality regression
- **Success Criteria**: Nightly job runs for 3 consecutive nights, producing ≥120 new accepted phrases each run.

### Task 5b – Duplicate Pre-Emption & Prompt Diversification (NEW)
- [ ] **Category-Scoped Bloom Filters**: Build per-category Bloom filters (using canonicalized lowercase tokens) seeded with all existing phrases; integrate into generation CLI so any AI candidate present in the filter is discarded immediately (saves scoring/runtime).
- [ ] **Dynamic `DONT_USE` Prompt Lists**: Extend prompt builder to inject a line like `"Avoid using any of these phrases: …"` containing up to the 50 most common phrases or recent duplicates for that category.
- [ ] **Rarity Seed Strategy**: For saturated categories supply 5–10 less-common sub-topics (e.g., "under-appreciated Olympic sports") to steer the model toward novelty.
- [ ] **Near-Duplicate Embedding Check**: Compute MiniLM/Sentence-Transformer embeddings for each candidate; reject if cosine similarity ≥0.92 with any stored phrase (catches synonyms/alias duplicates such as "NYC" vs "New York City").
- [ ] **Prompt Temperature/Top-p Sweep**: Run A/B tests across temperature 0.7→1.1 and top_p 0.8→1.0 to find setting that maximizes novelty without harming quality (score ≥70).
- [ ] **Yield Analytics Dashboard**: Add KPI tracking (duplicate % of *candidates*, accepted yield per batch) to nightly report and local CLI output.
- **Success Criteria**: Across 3 representative categories, duplicate rate among generated *candidates* drops below 40 % (currently 70–90 %), and average accepted phrases per 15-phrase batch rises from ~8 → ≥12.  Implementation demo via 10-batch test run with metrics in project status.

### Task 5c – AI Prompt Delivery Fix (CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED)
**Root Cause Analysis**: The enhanced prompts with duplicate avoidance are being built but NOT delivered to the AI! The `batch-queue-runner.js` creates sophisticated prompts with "don't use" lists and rarity seeds, but passes them as `customPrompt` in options which `api-client.js` completely ignores. Instead, the API client uses its own basic prompt generation without any duplicate avoidance.

**Required Fixes**:
- [x] **API Client Enhancement**: Modify `api-client.js` to accept and use custom prompts when provided in options
- [x] **Prompt Integration**: Ensure enhanced prompts from `promptBuilder` are actually sent to both OpenAI and Gemini APIs
- [x] **Format Compatibility**: Adapt enhanced prompt format to work with both OpenAI's structured format and Gemini's text format
- [x] **Validation Testing**: Add debug logging to confirm enhanced prompts are being sent and measure duplicate reduction
- **Success Criteria**: ✅ Enhanced prompts with "don't use" lists confirmed being sent to AI; ⚠️ duplicate generation rate varies widely by category (20-90%)

### Task 5d – Duplicate Mitigation Testing & Optimization (NEW)
**Problem Statement**: While enhanced prompts are now being delivered (Task 5c complete), initial testing shows highly variable effectiveness:
- Movies & TV: 90% duplicate rate (only 1 new from 10 candidates)
- Entertainment & Pop Culture: 20% duplicate rate (8 new from 10 candidates)
- This suggests the prompt engineering alone is insufficient for saturated categories

**Testing Protocol**:
- [ ] **A/B Testing Framework**: Add `--use-basic-prompt` flag to batch-queue-runner for controlled comparison
- [ ] **Baseline Metrics Collection**: Run 20 batches (10 enhanced, 10 basic) across 3 representative categories
- [ ] **Metrics to Track**: 
  - Duplicate rate among candidates (Bloom filter hits)
  - Accepted yield per batch (phrases stored / phrases generated)
  - Score distribution and quality consistency
  - Time per batch and API costs
- [ ] **Statistical Analysis**: T-test comparison of enhanced vs basic prompt effectiveness

**Optimization Strategies**:
- [ ] **Dynamic Temperature Adjustment**: Increase temperature (0.7→1.0) for saturated categories to encourage creativity
- [ ] **Semantic Embedding Filter**: Implement MiniLM embeddings to catch near-duplicates (e.g., "NYC" vs "New York City")
- [ ] **Category-Specific Prompt Templates**: Custom prompts for highly saturated categories (Movies & TV, Famous People)
- [ ] **Negative Example Weighting**: Emphasize "MUST NOT include variations of..." in prompt structure
- [ ] **Sub-category Targeting**: Force generation within specific niches (e.g., "1980s sci-fi movies" instead of general movies)

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create testing harness with A/B capability
2. Collect baseline metrics across categories
3. Implement top 2 optimization strategies based on data
4. Re-test and measure improvement
5. Document optimal settings per category

**Success Criteria**: 
- Duplicate rate among candidates drops below 40% for ALL categories (currently 20-90%)
- Average accepted phrases per 15-phrase batch rises to ≥10 (currently ~3-5)
- Consistent performance across saturated and non-saturated categories
- Clear documentation of optimal prompt settings per category

### Category Expansion Strategy (NEW APPROACH)

## Lessons Learned _(to be appended)_

**[2025-01-15] Enhanced Prompt Delivery Critical**: Simply building sophisticated prompts with "don't use" lists isn't enough - they must actually be delivered to the AI. The api-client.js was ignoring custom prompts entirely, leading to 70-90% duplicate rates in saturated categories.

**[2025-01-15] Prompt Engineering Has Limits**: Even with enhanced prompts delivered, duplicate rates vary wildly by category (20-90%). Saturated categories like "Movies & TV" need more aggressive strategies beyond just "don't use" lists - potentially higher temperature, semantic filtering, or forced sub-categorization.

**[2025-01-15] A/B Testing Essential**: Without controlled comparison between basic and enhanced prompts, it's impossible to quantify improvement. Always implement testing frameworks before claiming optimization success.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Task 5c: AI Prompt Delivery Fix Completion - 2025-01-15**

✅ **TASK 5c COMPLETE**: Enhanced Prompts Now Delivered to AI

**Implementation Details:**
- Modified `api-client.js` to accept `options` parameter with `customPrompt` support
- Updated both `generatePhrases` and `generatePhrasesWithFallback` methods
- Added debug logging to confirm prompt delivery for both OpenAI and Gemini
- Maintained backward compatibility for calls without custom prompts

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ Enhanced prompts confirmed delivered in debug logs
- ✅ Prompts include "don't use" lists (50 phrases) and rarity seeds (8 topics)
- ⚠️ **Effectiveness varies dramatically by category:**
  - Movies & TV: 90% duplicate rate (1 new from 10 candidates)
  - Entertainment & Pop Culture: 20% duplicate rate (8 new from 10)
- ⚠️ Overall acceptance rate only 25% in test batch
- ⚠️ Bloom filter efficiency 55% - still too many duplicates reaching scoring

**Critical Insights:**
1. The bug fix works - prompts are being delivered
2. But prompt engineering alone is insufficient for saturated categories
3. Need more aggressive duplicate mitigation strategies
4. Some categories may be approaching true saturation limits

**Recommendation:**
Created Task 5d for comprehensive testing and optimization. We need:
- A/B testing to quantify enhanced prompt effectiveness
- Category-specific optimization strategies
- Potentially semantic embedding filters for near-duplicates
- Temperature/creativity adjustments for saturated categories

**Questions for Planning:**
- Should we prioritize less-saturated categories while optimizing?
- Is 5,000 phrases realistic given saturation in some categories?
- Should we consider expanding category definitions to create more space?
