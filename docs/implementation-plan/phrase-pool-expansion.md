# Phrase Pool Expansion â€“ Roadmap to 5,000+ High-Quality Phrases

## Branch Name
`feature/phrase-pool-expansion`

---

## Background and Motivation

The game currently uses ~170 core phrases plus ~250 in-progress additions from the **phrase-database-generation** initiative. While the quality is now excellent thanks to the **phrase-quality-upgrade** project, quantity still limits replay value.  A sustainable pipeline is needed to scale the pool past **1 000 â†’ 5 000+** phrases across all categories while preserving the rigorous quality standards already in place.

Key existing assets we will build upon:
1. Phrase Database Builder CLI (SQLite-backed, duplicate detection, exporter)
2. Production AI generation functions (**OpenAI primary**, Gemini fallback)
3. Comprehensive 0-100 scoring & validation pipeline (local heuristics, Wikidata, Reddit)
4. Manual Review Interface built into the React app

---

## Key Challenges and Analysis

| # | Challenge | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|
| 1 | **Throughput** | Generating ~4 800 net new accepted phrases at ~8 accepted/15-phrase batch â‡’ ~600 API batches. Must stay within OpenAI rate-limits (3 RPM / 200 RPD default) & Netlify 10 s timeout. |
| 2 | **Quality Consistency** | Maintain â‰¥60 average score with <10 % manual review rejects while scaling. |
| 3 | **Category Balance** | Prevent over-representation of entertainment categories; enforce quotas dynamically. |
| 4 | **Automation vs. Review** | Human review cannot keep pace at current UI speed; need bulk-approve for 80+ scores and smarter triage. |
| 5 | **Incremental Deployment** | Avoid giant single release; ship in weekly 500-phrase increments, monitoring game balance & performance. |
| 6 | **Observability** | Require dashboards/metrics to track generation rate, score distribution, duplicate trends, review backlog, **provider-level quality comparisons**. |
| 7 | **Provider Migration** | Ensure prompt templates and retry logic work with OpenAI as default; Gemini remains tested fallback. |
| 8 | **API Key Scaling** | Support configuring multiple OpenAI API keys for higher RPM/RPD if needed. |

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Provider Switch Pre-Task âœ…
- [x] Update environment configuration so `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present and used by default service layer
- [x] Modify `api-client.js` to attempt OpenAI first, Gemini as fallback
- [x] Validate prompts against GPT-4o and adjust temperature/max_tokens as needed
- **Success Criteria**: âœ… ALL MET - Generation CLI produces a 15-phrase batch via OpenAI in <10 s with â‰¥50 % acceptable phrases.

**Implementation Results:**
- âœ… OpenAI now primary service (was Gemini)
- âœ… Database schema updated with `source_provider` and `model_id` columns
- âœ… Quality pipeline includes provider attribution
- âœ… Analytics script created for provider comparison
- âœ… API client correctly handles OpenAI's direct array response format
- âœ… End-to-end test validates: connectivity, fallback order, attribution, storage
- âœ… All success criteria met: OpenAI primary, attribution recorded, migration complete, quality pipeline working, <10s processing

**Technical Notes:**
- OpenAI function returns direct array format: `[{id, phrase, topic, difficulty}]`
- Gemini remains functional fallback with existing JSON array parsing
- Database migration system handles schema upgrades gracefully
- Provider attribution enables quality comparison analytics

### Task 0 â€“ Project Setup
- [ ] Create feature branch `feature/phrase-pool-expansion` off latest `main`
- [ ] Link existing **phrase-database-generation** branch as dependency; coordinate merges
- **Success Criteria**: Branch created; plan committed; scratchpad updated.

### Task 1 â€“ Architecture Consolidation
- [ ] Map current data flow end-to-end (AI â†’ scoring â†’ DB â†’ export â†’ game import), **including provider & model attribution metadata**
- [ ] Refactor/rename scripts for clarity (`generate-batch`, `process-batch`, `export-game-json`), ensure `sourceProvider` field propagates
- [ ] Extract shared config (categories, score thresholds) into `/config`
- **Success Criteria**: Up-to-date architecture diagram + README section; CLI commands produce identical output as before.

### Task 2 â€“ Throughput & Automation Enhancements
- [ ] Add **batch-queue runner** that iterates categories until quota met, with optional round-robin across multiple OpenAI API keys
- [ ] Implement **concurrent generation** (max 2 parallel batches) with rate-limit guard
- [ ] Persist generation log (`data/generation-log.json`) for resume on crash
- **Success Criteria**: Tool can autonomously generate 150 phrases (~10 batches) in <20 min without manual supervision.

### Task 3 â€“ Review Workflow Upgrade
- [ ] Extend scoring: auto-accept â‰¥70, auto-reject <40, queue 40-69
- [ ] Build **bulk review dashboard** inside phrase review interface (keyboard shortcuts, batch approve)
- [ ] Add CSV export/import option for crowdsourced review
- **Success Criteria**: Reviewer can process 300 queued phrases in â‰¤30 min; acceptance & rejection reflected in DB.

### Task 3b â€“ Provider Attribution & Analytics
- [ ] Add `sourceProvider` TEXT and `modelId` TEXT columns to SQLite schema (e.g., provider "openai", modelId "gpt-4o-2025-06-13")
- [ ] Update `api-client.js` and CLI so each stored phrase records its provider **and exact model id**
- [ ] Extend `quality-pipeline.js` to log provider & model with scores
- [ ] Add analytics script `analyze-provider-quality.js` that outputs per-provider & per-model average score, acceptance rate, duplicate rate
- **Success Criteria**: After â‰¥3 mixed batches, analysis script outputs metrics split by provider and model id; DB migration retains existing data.

### Task 4 â€“ Phase I Expansion to 2 000 Phrases
- [ ] Generate & review until each category hits **minimum 150 phrases** (target total â‰ˆ2 000)
- [ ] Run duplicate & obscenity scans; fix issues
- [ ] Export `phrases-v2.json`; integrate into game; run 10-round playtest
- **Success Criteria**: Game loads 2 000-phrase file; playtest shows no dupes/objectionable phrases; category counts correct.

### Task 5 â€“ Continuous Generation Pipeline
- [ ] Add **GitHub Actions** (or Netlify scheduled function) nightly job: `npm run generate-nightly --max-batches 20`
- [ ] On success, open automated PR with new phrases & metrics
- [ ] Alert on failure or quality regression
- **Success Criteria**: Nightly job runs for 3 consecutive nights, producing â‰¥120 new accepted phrases each run.

### Task 6 â€“ Phase II Expansion to 5 000 Phrases
- [ ] Iterate nightly pipeline for ~4 weeks
- [ ] Weekly QA play-sessions; adjust prompts/thresholds based on feedback
- [ ] Maintain <2 % duplicate rate using enhanced detector
- **Success Criteria**: `phrases.json` shows â‰¥5 000 unique phrases with quality metrics: avg â‰¥65, stdev â‰¤12.

### Task 7 â€“ Documentation & Handoff
- [ ] Update `docs/phrase-quality-guidelines.md` with large-scale learnings
- [ ] Record maintenance SOP for future expansions
- [ ] Final retro in scratchpad Lessons Learned
- **Success Criteria**: Documentation merged; project marked **COMPLETE** by Planner.

   - Response parsing handles OpenAI's direct array format: `[{id, phrase, topic, difficulty}]`
   - Provider attribution included in generatePhrasesWithFallback return value

3. **Database Schema Migration** (`tools/phrase-database/src/database.js`):
   - Schema version updated to v2 with automatic migration system
   - New columns: `source_provider` TEXT, `model_id` TEXT
   - Migration handles existing databases gracefully with column existence checks
   - addPhrase method updated to accept and store provider attribution

4. **Quality Pipeline Enhanced** (`tools/phrase-database/src/quality-pipeline.js`):
   - processBatch and processSinglePhrase methods updated with provider/model parameters
   - All processed phrases include sourceProvider and modelId fields
   - Default service changed from 'gemini' to 'openai'

5. **Analytics System Created** (`tools/phrase-database/scripts/analyze-provider-quality.js`):
   - Comprehensive provider comparison analytics
   - Metrics: overall stats, provider comparison, model comparison, category performance
   - Quality distribution analysis with visual charts
   - Ready for production provider performance monitoring
