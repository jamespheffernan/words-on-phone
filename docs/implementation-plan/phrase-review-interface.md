# Phrase Review Interface (Keyboard-Driven Approval Tool)

**Branch Name:** `feature/phrase-review-interface`

## Background and Motivation

The user wants a keyboard-driven web interface to review newly generated phrases from `phrases.json` (1,191 phrases). This will be a standalone tool to curate phrases before they're added to the main game.

**Requirements:**
- Sidebar list of all phrases with navigation
- Center panel displaying current phrase in large text
- Keyboard-driven workflow (approve/reject with reasons)
- JSON export of review results
- Ability to jump around for obvious examples
- Search functionality to find specific phrases

**Decision:** Build as standalone React app in `tools/phrase-review/` to avoid coupling with main app.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Data Loading**: Need to fetch and parse 1,191 phrases from JSON
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Implement comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
3. **State Management**: Track decisions per phrase with persistence
4. **UI Layout**: Efficient sidebar + center panel design
5. **Export Functionality**: Generate JSON with review results
6. **Search & Filtering**: Quick phrase finding capabilities

## Lessons Learned

- [2024-12-19] Standalone React apps are better than routing integration for specialized tools
- [2024-12-19] Testing keyboard interactions requires careful mocking of DOM APIs like scrollIntoView
- [2024-12-19] @testing-library/user-event setup() method requires specific version compatibility
- [2024-12-19] CSS accessibility features like reduced motion and high contrast are essential for inclusive design
