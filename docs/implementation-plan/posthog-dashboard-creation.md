# PostHog Dashboard Creation Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The user has requested to programmatically build PostHog dashboards, which has failed multiple times in the past. PostHog analytics is now working properly (events are showing up in Live Events), but we need to create meaningful dashboards to visualize the data. The key challenge is understanding the correct API approach for creating dashboards and insights programmatically.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### 1. **API Documentation Gaps**
- PostHog documentation mentions "Dashboards" and "Insights" endpoints, but lacks detailed examples
- The API supports creating, updating, and deleting dashboards/insights
- Need to understand the exact payload structure for creating insights and dashboards

### 2. **Dashboard Creation Process**
Based on research, PostHog dashboards require:
- Creating insights first (trends, funnels, retention, etc.)
- Adding insights to dashboards
- Configuring dashboard layout and settings

### 3. **Authentication & API Access**
- Requires Personal API key with appropriate scopes
- Different endpoints for private operations vs public data
- US Cloud endpoints: `https://us.posthog.com` for private, `https://us.i.posthog.com` for public

### 4. **Technical Approach**
From the research, we need to:
1. Use the `/api/insights/` endpoint to create insights
2. Use the `/api/dashboards/` endpoint to create dashboards
3. Configure insights with SQL queries or event-based filters
4. Handle pagination and rate limits (240/min, 1200/hour for analytics endpoints)

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create Feature Branch
- Create branch: `feature/posthog-dashboards`
- Success criteria: Branch created and checked out

### Task 2: Research PostHog API Schema
- Explore the OpenAPI spec from PostHog instance
- Document insight and dashboard payload structures
- Test API endpoints with curl/Postman
- Success criteria: Clear understanding of required payloads

### Task 3: Create Dashboard Setup Script
- Build Node.js script using existing setup-posthog-dashboards.js as base
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Include Personal API key configuration
- Success criteria: Script structure ready with authentication

### Task 4: Implement Core Insights Creation
Create key insights for Words on Phone:
1. **Daily Active Users** - Trend of unique users per day
2. **Game Completions** - Count of game_ended events
3. **Category Performance** - Breakdown by category
4. **Skip Usage** - Track skip_used events
5. **Average Game Duration** - Time between game_started and game_ended

Success criteria: Each insight created successfully via API

### Task 5: Create Main Dashboard
- Create "Words on Phone - Overview" dashboard
- Add all core insights to dashboard
- Configure layout and refresh settings
- Success criteria: Dashboard visible in PostHog UI with all insights

### Task 6: Implement Advanced Dashboards
Create specialized dashboards:
1. **User Engagement Dashboard**
   - Session duration
   - Retention cohorts
   - Feature adoption (settings, category requests)
   
2. **Performance Metrics Dashboard**
   - Error rates
   - API response times
   - Page load performance

Success criteria: Both dashboards created with relevant insights

### Task 7: Add Dashboard Templates
- Create reusable dashboard configurations
- Export dashboard JSON for version control
- Document dashboard structure
- Success criteria: Templates stored and documented

### Task 8: Test and Validate
- Verify all dashboards load correctly
- Check data accuracy
- Test auto-refresh functionality
- Validate sharing/embedding works
- Success criteria: All dashboards functional with real data

### Task 9: Documentation
- Document API endpoints used
- Create setup instructions
- Add troubleshooting guide
- Success criteria: Complete documentation in project

### Task 10: Deploy and Monitor
- Run setup script in production
- Verify dashboards appear
- Monitor for any API errors
- Success criteria: Dashboards live in production PostHog

## Branch Name
`feature/posthog-dashboards`

## Lessons Learned
- [2025-01-22] PostHog has both Dashboards and Insights APIs - insights must be created first, then added to dashboards
- [2025-01-22] Personal API keys need specific scopes for creating dashboards/insights
- [2025-01-22] PostHog provides OpenAPI spec that can be downloaded when logged in for exact payload structures
- [2025-01-22] **API Research Success**: Found existing setup-posthog-dashboards.js script already implements basic dashboard creation via API
- [2025-01-22] **Payload Structure Identified**: Dashboard creation requires name, description, filters, and tags; Insights require query object with specific structure
- [2025-01-22] **Rate Limits Critical**: 240/min and 1200/hour for analytics endpoints - must implement proper throttling for large-scale dashboard creation

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Status**: API Research Complete - Task 2 complete

**Progress Summary:**
- ✅ **Task 1 COMPLETE**: Feature branch `feature/posthog-dashboards` created successfully  
- ✅ **Task 2 COMPLETE**: PostHog API schema research completed with comprehensive findings
- **Current Branch**: feature/posthog-dashboards
- **Last Commit**: 2fdec8e2 - Task 1 completion and progress tracking
- **Ready for**: Task 3 - Dashboard setup script creation

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Task 1 Completion Report (2025-01-22)
✅ **TASK 1 SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**
- Feature branch `feature/posthog-dashboards` created and active
- All PostHog documentation changes committed to main (commit 1894915c)
- Clean git status, ready for implementation work
- Success criteria met: Branch created and checked out ✅

### Task 2 Completion Report (2025-01-22)
✅ **TASK 2 SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**
- Comprehensive PostHog API research completed
- API endpoints documented for dashboards and insights
- Authentication patterns and payload structures identified
- Existing infrastructure analyzed (setup-posthog-dashboards.js script found)

### Key Research Findings:
1. **Dashboard API**: `/api/projects/:project_id/dashboards/` for CRUD operations
2. **Insights API**: `/api/projects/:project_id/insights/` for creating visualizations  
3. **Authentication**: Personal API key required with appropriate scopes
4. **Rate Limits**: 240/min, 1200/hour for analytics endpoints
5. **Payload Structures**: Documented for both dashboards and insights
6. **Existing Script**: Found working implementation in words-on-phone-app/scripts/

### Ready for Task 3
Ready to proceed with **Task 3: Create Dashboard Setup Script**. The task involves:
1. Enhancing existing setup-posthog-dashboards.js script
2. Adding error handling and logging improvements
3. Configuring Personal API key authentication
4. Creating comprehensive dashboard configuration

**Question for Human User**: Should I proceed with Task 3 (Dashboard Setup Script), or would you like to review Task 2 research findings first?
