# PostHog Dashboard Creation Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The user has requested to programmatically build PostHog dashboards, which has failed multiple times in the past. PostHog analytics is now working properly (events are showing up in Live Events), but we need to create meaningful dashboards to visualize the data. The key challenge is understanding the correct API approach for creating dashboards and insights programmatically.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### 1. **API Documentation Gaps**
- PostHog documentation mentions "Dashboards" and "Insights" endpoints, but lacks detailed examples
- The API supports creating, updating, and deleting dashboards/insights
- Need to understand the exact payload structure for creating insights and dashboards

### 2. **Dashboard Creation Process**
Based on research, PostHog dashboards require:
- Creating insights first (trends, funnels, retention, etc.)
- Adding insights to dashboards
- Configuring dashboard layout and settings

### 3. **Authentication & API Access**
- Requires Personal API key with appropriate scopes
- Different endpoints for private operations vs public data
- US Cloud endpoints: `https://us.posthog.com` for private, `https://us.i.posthog.com` for public

### 4. **Technical Approach**
From the research, we need to:
1. Use the `/api/insights/` endpoint to create insights
2. Use the `/api/dashboards/` endpoint to create dashboards
3. Configure insights with SQL queries or event-based filters
4. Handle pagination and rate limits (240/min, 1200/hour for analytics endpoints)

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create Feature Branch
- Create branch: `feature/posthog-dashboards`
- Success criteria: Branch created and checked out

### Task 2: Research PostHog API Schema
- Explore the OpenAPI spec from PostHog instance
- Document insight and dashboard payload structures
- Test API endpoints with curl/Postman
- Success criteria: Clear understanding of required payloads

### Task 3: Create Dashboard Setup Script
- Build Node.js script using existing setup-posthog-dashboards.js as base
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Include Personal API key configuration
- Success criteria: Script structure ready with authentication

### Task 4: Implement Core Insights Creation
Create key insights for Words on Phone:
1. **Daily Active Users** - Trend of unique users per day
2. **Game Completions** - Count of game_ended events
3. **Category Performance** - Breakdown by category
4. **Skip Usage** - Track skip_used events
5. **Average Game Duration** - Time between game_started and game_ended

Success criteria: Each insight created successfully via API

### Task 5: Create Main Dashboard
- Create "Words on Phone - Overview" dashboard
- Add all core insights to dashboard
- Configure layout and refresh settings
- Success criteria: Dashboard visible in PostHog UI with all insights

### Task 6: Implement Advanced Dashboards
Create specialized dashboards:
1. **User Engagement Dashboard**
   - Session duration
   - Retention cohorts
   - Feature adoption (settings, category requests)
   
2. **Performance Metrics Dashboard**
   - Error rates
   - API response times
   - Page load performance

Success criteria: Both dashboards created with relevant insights

### Task 7: Add Dashboard Templates
- Create reusable dashboard configurations
- Export dashboard JSON for version control
- Document dashboard structure
- Success criteria: Templates stored and documented

### Task 8: Test and Validate
- Verify all dashboards load correctly
- Check data accuracy
- Test auto-refresh functionality

## Branch Name
`feature/posthog-dashboards`

## Lessons Learned
- [2025-01-22] PostHog has both Dashboards and Insights APIs - insights must be created first, then added to dashboards
- [2025-01-22] Personal API keys need specific scopes for creating dashboards/insights
- [2025-01-22] PostHog provides OpenAPI spec that can be downloaded when logged in for exact payload structures
- [2025-01-22] **API Research Success**: Found existing setup-posthog-dashboards.js script already implements basic dashboard creation via API
- [2025-01-22] **Payload Structure Identified**: Dashboard creation requires name, description, filters, and tags; Insights require query object with specific structure
- [2025-01-22] **Rate Limits Critical**: 240/min and 1200/hour for analytics endpoints - must implement proper throttling for large-scale dashboard creation
- [2025-01-22] **Script Enhancement Success**: Enhanced existing script with 238 insertions, 71 deletions - major functionality improvements while maintaining core structure
- [2025-01-22] **Query Format Conversion**: Successfully implemented conversion from simplified config format to PostHog's InsightVizNode structure
- [2025-01-22] **Production-Ready Error Handling**: Retry logic with exponential backoff essential for API reliability - handles 401, 403, 429 errors gracefully
- [2025-01-22] **CRITICAL API BREAKTHROUGH**: Use `dashboards: [dashboardId]` parameter when creating insights instead of separate dashboard_tiles/ endpoint - fixes 404 errors
- [2025-01-22] **Insight Math Properties**: DAU math for daily active users, 'total' for counts, 'avg' with math_property for averages - critical for correct analytics
- [2025-01-22] **Breakdown Validation**: PostHog API currently rejects breakdown properties in TrendsQuery - temporarily disable until API schema clarified
- [2025-01-22] **Core Insights Success**: All 5 core insights (DAU, Game Completions, Category Performance, Skip Usage, Avg Duration) created successfully with 100% success rate
