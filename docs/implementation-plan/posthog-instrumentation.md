### Bug Fix Phase 2 • 2025-07-24 – Missing Capture Requests Despite Initialization ✅ **RESOLVED**

**ISSUE RESOLVED**: PostHog SDK was loading but not attaching to `window.posthog` object.
**SOLUTION**: Manual window attachment in loaded callback with fallback timeout.
**RESULT**: Complete restoration of PostHog analytics functionality.

#### Project Status Board (Bug-Fix Phase 2)
- [ ] **Task 16** – Deep Dive Debugging: Check opt-out status, privacy settings, event sampling
- [ ] **Task 17** – Verify PostHog SDK Loading: Check if SDK is actually making it to production bundle
- [ ] **Task 18** – Test PostHog Key Validity: Verify the key works with direct API test
- [ ] **Task 19** – Add Comprehensive Debug Mode: Log every analytics call attempt
- [ ] **Task 20** – Network Layer Investigation: Check for CORS, CSP, or browser blocking
- [ ] **Task 21** – Alternative Implementation: Consider server-side event tracking if client-side fails

#### High-level Task Breakdown (Phase 2)

1. **Deep Analytics State Inspection**
   • Check localStorage for `analyticsOptOut=true`
   • Verify anonymous ID is being generated
   • Check if events are being sampled out (25% sampling for some events)
   • Inspect PostHog SDK state directly

2. **PostHog SDK Verification**
   • Confirm PostHog JS is in production bundle
   • Check bundle size to ensure SDK isn't tree-shaken out
   • Verify `window.posthog` object has capture method
   • Test direct `window.posthog.capture()` call

3. **API Key Validation**
   • Create minimal test to verify key works
   • Check PostHog project settings for any restrictions
   • Verify project is active and accepting events
   • Test with curl/direct API call using the key

4. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
   • Add console.log to every track() call
   • Log PostHog responses/errors
   • Add debug flag to see all analytics attempts
   • Check browser console for any silent errors

5. **Network & Security Investigation**
   • Check Content Security Policy headers
   • Look for ad blockers or privacy extensions
   • Test in incognito mode
   • Check if requests are blocked at network level

6. **Fallback Strategy**
   • Consider server-side analytics via Netlify Functions
   • Implement basic event queue for debugging
   • Add manual flush capability
   • Create analytics health check endpoint

### Bug Fix • 2025-07-24 – Missing PostHog Events in Production 🚨

Despite analytics being reported as live, production is currently **not sending any events** to PostHog ("1 user online" only, zero events).  We need a rapid-response bug-fix iteration to restore end-to-end analytics.

#### Project Status Board (Bug-Fix) - ✅ **ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED**
- [x] **Task 10** – Reproduce Issue & Network Debugging (verify capture calls, console output) ✅
- [x] **Task 11** – Environment Variable Verification & Hot-fix (ensure `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` available **or** add fallback) ✅
- [x] **Task 12** – Add Runtime Debug Logging + Init Guard (warn if analytics disabled) ✅
- [x] **Task 13** – Production Deployment & Post-deployment Verification (events visible in PostHog) ✅
- [x] **Task 14** – Window Attachment Fix & Production Cleanup ✅
- [x] **Task 15** – Documentation & Lessons Learned Update ✅

#### High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Reproduce + Collect Evidence**  
   • Load production site, open DevTools Network → filter `/?v=...&ip=...` (PostHog)  
   • Confirm whether `https://us.i.posthog.com/capture` requests fire or are blocked.  
   • Check console for "PostHog analytics initialized" message.

2. **Environment Variable Audit**  
   • Inspect `env.POSTHOG_KEY` value in production (console `import.meta.env`).  
   • Hypothesis: Netlify env variable is `POSTHOG_KEY` (no `VITE_` prefix) so code receives `undefined`.  
   • Fix Options:  
     a) Add `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` & (optional) `VITE_POSTHOG_HOST` in Netlify dashboard.  
     b) OR modify `environment.ts` to fallback to `POSTHOG_KEY` when `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` missing.

3. **Code Hot-fix & Debug Logging**  
   • Update `environment.ts` fallback logic.  
   • In `AnalyticsService.init()` log explicit warning if key missing (`console.warn('PostHog disabled – missing key')`).

4. **Local & Preview Verification**  
   • Serve app locally with `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` to ensure events fire.  
   • Deploy Netlify Deploy Preview ↗ check PostHog live events.

5. **Production Deployment**  
   • Merge hot-fix branch `bugfix/posthog-events` → `main` (squash).  
   • Verify events visible in production dashboards within 5-10 minutes.

6. **Automated Test Coverage**  
   • Unit test: `env.POSTHOG_KEY` undefined → `init()` early-exit + warning.  
   • Add Cypress test to spy on `window.posthog.capture` for `screen_viewed` on app load.

7. **Documentation & Lessons Learned**  
   • Update `docs/analytics/README.md` env-var section.  
   • Add scratchpad entry summarizing root cause & fix.
