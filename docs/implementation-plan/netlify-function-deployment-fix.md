# Netlify Function Deployment Fix - 404 Error Resolution

**Branch Name:** `fix/netlify-function-404`

---

## Background and Motivation

The custom category request feature is failing in production with a **404 error** when trying to access the Gemini Netlify function at `/netlify/functions/gemini`. Despite the CORS fix documentation claiming successful production deployment, the function is not accessible at the expected endpoint.

**Current Error (Production):**
```
POST https://words-on-phone.netlify.app/netlify/functions/gemini 404 (Not Found)
Worker error: Event
Category request failed: Error: API error: 404
```

**Critical Discrepancy Identified:**
- The CORS fix documentation claims successful production testing with `https://words-on-phone.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/gemini` ‚úÖ
- But the actual production error shows the app is trying to access `/netlify/functions/gemini` (missing the dot) ‚ùå
- The environment configuration in `environment.ts` shows production URL as `/netlify/functions/gemini` (no dot)
- The function exists at `words-on-phone-app/netlify/functions/gemini.ts` but may not be deploying correctly

**Context:**
- Function exists in codebase at `words-on-phone-app/netlify/functions/gemini.ts`
- Netlify configuration sets base to `words-on-phone-app` and functions to `netlify/functions`
- CORS headers are properly implemented in the function
- Development environment works correctly using `http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/gemini`

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **URL Path Mismatch**: Production configuration expects `/netlify/functions/gemini` but deployed functions may be at `/.netlify/functions/gemini`
2. **Netlify Build Configuration**: Need to verify functions are building and deploying correctly from the `words-on-phone-app` base directory
3. **Function Deployment Path**: Netlify may be deploying functions to a different path than expected
4. **Environment Variable Access**: Function may not have access to `GEMINI_API_KEY` in production environment
5. **Previous Documentation Inconsistency**: CORS fix claims successful testing but uses different URL than actual production code

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Diagnose Function Deployment Status
- [ ] Check Netlify deployment logs to verify function building process
- [ ] Verify function exists in the deployed Netlify function directory
- [ ] Test both `/netlify/functions/gemini` and `/.netlify/functions/gemini` endpoints in production
- [ ] Check Netlify dashboard function logs for any build or runtime errors
- [ ] Verify environment variables (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) are properly configured in Netlify

**Success Criteria:**
1. Function deployment status is clearly identified
2. Correct production function URL path is determined
3. Environment variable configuration is verified
4. Any build or deployment errors are identified

### Task 2: Fix Function URL Configuration
- [ ] Update production URL in `environment.ts` to match actual Netlify function path
- [ ] Verify function deployment directory structure in `netlify.toml`
- [ ] Test function accessibility after URL correction
- [ ] Ensure consistency between development and production URL patterns

**Success Criteria:**
1. Production function URL correctly points to deployed function
2. Function responds to OPTIONS and POST requests in production
3. No 404 errors when accessing function endpoint
4. Development/production URL configuration is consistent

### Task 3: Verify Function Build and Environment
- [ ] Check Netlify build logs for function compilation
- [ ] Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is accessible to function
- [ ] Test function response with proper authentication
- [ ] Confirm function dependencies (`@netlify/functions`) are properly installed

**Success Criteria:**
1. Function builds successfully in Netlify environment
2. Environment variables are accessible within function
3. Function returns proper responses (not just 404)
4. All function dependencies are available

### Task 4: End-to-End Production Testing
- [ ] Test custom category request feature in production environment
- [ ] Verify CORS headers are working correctly
- [ ] Confirm full category generation workflow
- [ ] Update documentation with correct production configuration

**Success Criteria:**
1. Custom category request feature works end-to-end in production
2. No CORS errors in browser console
3. Successful category and phrase generation
4. Documentation reflects actual working configuration
