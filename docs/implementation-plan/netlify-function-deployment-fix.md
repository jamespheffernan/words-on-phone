# Netlify Function Deployment Fix - 404 Error Resolution

**Branch Name:** `fix/netlify-function-404`

---

## Background and Motivation

The custom category request feature is failing in production with a **404 error** when trying to access the Gemini Netlify function at `/netlify/functions/gemini`. Despite the CORS fix documentation claiming successful production deployment, the function is not accessible at the expected endpoint.

**Current Error (Production):**
```
POST https://words-on-phone.netlify.app/netlify/functions/gemini 404 (Not Found)
Worker error: Event
Category request failed: Error: API error: 404
```

**Critical Discrepancy Identified:**
- The CORS fix documentation claims successful production testing with `https://words-on-phone.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/gemini` ✅
- But the actual production error shows the app is trying to access `/netlify/functions/gemini` (missing the dot) ❌
- The environment configuration in `environment.ts` shows production URL as `/netlify/functions/gemini` (no dot)
- The function exists at `words-on-phone-app/netlify/functions/gemini.ts` but may not be deploying correctly

**Context:**
- Function exists in codebase at `words-on-phone-app/netlify/functions/gemini.ts`
- Netlify configuration sets base to `words-on-phone-app` and functions to `netlify/functions`
- CORS headers are properly implemented in the function
- Development environment works correctly using `http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/gemini`

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **URL Path Mismatch**: Production configuration expects `/netlify/functions/gemini` but deployed functions may be at `/.netlify/functions/gemini`
2. **Netlify Build Configuration**: Need to verify functions are building and deploying correctly from the `words-on-phone-app` base directory
3. **Function Deployment Path**: Netlify may be deploying functions to a different path than expected
4. **Environment Variable Access**: Function may not have access to `GEMINI_API_KEY` in production environment
5. **Previous Documentation Inconsistency**: CORS fix claims successful testing but uses different URL than actual production code

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Diagnose Function Deployment Status
- [x] Check Netlify deployment logs to verify function building process
- [x] Verify function exists in the deployed Netlify function directory
- [x] Test both `/netlify/functions/gemini` and `/.netlify/functions/gemini` endpoints in production
- [x] Check Netlify dashboard function logs for any build or runtime errors
- [x] Verify environment variables (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) are properly configured in Netlify

**Success Criteria:**
1. Function deployment status is clearly identified ✅
2. Correct production function URL path is determined ✅
3. Environment variable configuration is verified ✅
4. Any build or deployment errors are identified ✅

### Task 2: Fix Function URL Configuration
- [x] Update production URL in `environment.ts` to match actual Netlify function path
- [x] Verify function deployment directory structure in `netlify.toml`
- [x] Test function accessibility after URL correction
- [x] Ensure consistency between development and production URL patterns

**Success Criteria:**
1. Production function URL correctly points to deployed function ✅
2. Function responds to OPTIONS and POST requests in production ✅
3. No 404 errors when accessing function endpoint ✅
4. Development/production URL configuration is consistent ✅

### Task 3: Verify Function Build and Environment
- [x] Check Netlify build logs for function compilation
- [x] Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is accessible to function
- [x] Test function response with proper authentication
- [x] Confirm function dependencies (`@netlify/functions`) are properly installed

**Success Criteria:**
1. Function builds successfully in Netlify environment ✅
2. Environment variables are accessible within function ✅
3. Function returns proper responses (not just 404) ✅
4. All function dependencies are available ✅

### Task 4: End-to-End Production Testing
- [x] Test custom category request feature in production environment
- [x] Verify CORS headers are working correctly
- [x] Confirm full category generation workflow
- [x] Update documentation with correct production configuration

**Success Criteria:**
1. Custom category request feature works end-to-end in production ✅
2. No CORS errors in browser console ✅
3. Successful category and phrase generation ✅
4. Documentation reflects actual working configuration ✅

## Project Status Board

### Tasks
- [x] **Task 1**: Diagnose Function Deployment Status - **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Task 2**: Fix Function URL Configuration - **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Task 3**: Verify Function Build and Environment - **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Task 4**: End-to-End Production Testing - **COMPLETED**

### Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Status**: ✅ **ALL TASKS COMPLETED** - Production deployment fully functional

**Key Findings and Fixes:**
- **Root Cause Confirmed**: Function exists at `/.netlify/functions/gemini` but app was calling `/netlify/functions/gemini` (missing dot)
- **URL Fix Applied**: Updated production URLs in `environment.ts` and `phraseWorker.ts` to use correct path with dot prefix
- **Deployment Successful**: Changes merged to main and deployed to production
- **Function Verification**: POST requests to `/.netlify/functions/gemini` return HTTP 200 with valid Gemini API responses
- **Environment Variables**: `GEMINI_API_KEY` is properly configured and accessible to function

**Technical Verification Results:**
- ✅ **OPTIONS Request**: `curl -X OPTIONS https://words-on-phone.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/gemini` returns **200 OK** with CORS headers
- ✅ **POST Request**: Function successfully processes Gemini API requests and returns valid JSON responses
- ✅ **URL Fix**: Both `environment.ts` and `phraseWorker.ts` now use correct production URL `/.netlify/functions/gemini`
- ✅ **Build Success**: Application builds without errors and deploys correctly to Netlify
