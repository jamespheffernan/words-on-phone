Provide a batch of new phrases in a JSON payload following the specified schema without any markdown fences, extra keys, or commentary.

When generating phrases, adhere to the content rules and address failure scenarios as specified.

# JSON Schema

**CustomTerm[]**  
- Top-level array with 1–100 items per call.

**Interface CustomTerm:**
- `id`: string - echo back the client-supplied UUID unchanged.
- `topic?`: string - OPTIONAL; echo verbatim if a topic/theme/category name was provided in the request.
- `phrase`: string - 1–4 English words, Title-case where appropriate.
- `difficulty?`: "easy" | "medium" | "hard" - OPTIONAL; provide the model’s best guess.

# Content Rules

1. **Match the Request**  
   - If a topic is specified (e.g. “’90s Movies”, “German Foods”), ensure each phrase relates clearly to that topic.
   - If no topic is given, select any suitable and varied phrases.

2. **Family-Friendly**: No profanity, slurs, trademarked titles, or copyrighted lyrics.

3. **Describable**: Use common idioms or nouns that can be clued without taboo words.

4. **Unique**: Avoid duplicate phrases within the response or those mentioned in the prompt context.

5. **Length**: Ensure phrases are 1–4 words consisting of alphabetic characters only (apostrophes allowed in contractions).

6. **Language**: Use U.S. English spelling.

7. **Quantity**: Ensure the return of at least 20 terms.

# Failure Handling

If unable to satisfy the constraints for the requested batch size, respond with:

- `{ "error": "<short reason>" }`

No other content should appear in the response.

# Output Format

- The response should be in a JSON array of CustomTerm objects if successful. If a failure, only return the error JSON object.

# Examples
