# Current Implementation Status

## Active Task: PhraseMachine v2 Dataset Build
**Implementation Plan:** `docs/implementation-plan/phrasemachine-v2-dataset-build.md`
**Branch:** `feature/dataset-build`

## Current Phase: Task 7 - COMPLETE! âœ…

### âœ… Completed Phases (Tasks 1-7):
- **Dataset Build Foundation:** All production datasets created and bundled
- **Final Bundle Size:** 0.01 MB compressed (83.8% compression)
- **Dual-Mode System:** Redis + JSON fallback modes implemented
- **Performance Validated:** JSON mode averages 1.3ms per phrase (<10ms target)
- **Backward Compatible:** Redis mode continues working unchanged

### ðŸš€ MAJOR RESTRUCTURING COMPLETE: PhraseMachine v2 â†’ Phrase Generator
**STRATEGIC TRANSFORMATION EXECUTED:** The project has pivoted from a phrase *scoring* system to a phrase *generation* system.

**Current Status:** 
- âœ… Complete restructuring implemented per `docs/RESTRUCTURING-PLAN.md`
- âœ… New architecture: curated data â†’ generators â†’ phrases.json (195 unique phrases)
- âœ… Quality validation: all checks passed, proper categorization, 0 duplicates
- âœ… Build pipeline integrated: generates + validates phrases in <2 seconds
- âœ… Output: 26.5KB phrases.json (2.4KB compressed) ready for production

**System Now Generates Quality Rather Than Finding Quality:** Infinitely scalable through curated entity expansion.

### ðŸ“Œ Upcoming Projects
1. **Entity Expansion â€“ Phase 1 (500+ entities)** â†’ see `docs/implementation-plan/entity-expansion-500-entities.md`
2. **Game Integration â€“ Use Generated Phrases** â†’ see `docs/implementation-plan/game-integration-new-phrases.md`

## Lessons Learned
- [2025-07-31] Always run phrasemachine-v2 scripts from its subdirectory to avoid ENOENT errors
- [2025-08-05] Wikidata SPARQL endpoint has become increasingly unreliable - even 1k entity queries timeout. Consider alternative data sources or very limited API use
- [2025-08-06] Full Wikidata dump streaming is NOT viable (100GB+, takes hours). Use curated expansion + pre-filtered datasets instead
- [2025-08-06] **STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Curated phrase *generation* produces better results than scoring random phrases. Quality by design beats quality by filtering.
