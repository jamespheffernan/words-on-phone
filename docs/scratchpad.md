# Scratchpad

This scratchpad tracks the overarching vision, active implementation plans, and lessons learned while building **Words on Phone**.

## Active Implementation Plans

- [8-week-roadmap](implementation-plan/8-week-roadmap.md) - **Phase 8C In Progress** - Accelerating Beep "Hot Potato" Timer System

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Completed Phases:**
- âœ… **Phase 1** (Week 1): Complete React app structure, core navigation, basic components
- âœ… **Phase 2** (Week 2): Core game logic, phrase categories, skip limits, state management  
- âœ… **Phase 3** (Week 3): High-precision timer, Web Audio API, offline capabilities
- âœ… **Phase 4** (Week 4): Options panel, skip-limit features, Firebase analytics, IndexedDB persistence
- âœ… **Phase 5** (Week 5): OpenAI phrase-fetcher with Web Worker, deduplication, throttling
- âœ… **Phase 6** (Week 6): Capacitor mobile app, iOS deployment
- âœ… **Phase 7** (Week 7): QA, performance optimization, accessibility (Lighthouse: Performance 78/100, Accessibility 95/100, Best Practices 96/100, SEO 90/100)
- âœ… **Phase 8A** (Week 8A): Custom Category Request System (user requests category â†’ see sample words â†’ generate 50+ phrases)
- âœ… **Phase 8B** (Week 8B): Enhanced Timer UX (randomized duration 45-75s, hidden by default, optional visible/fixed timer)

**Currently Active:**
- ðŸš§ **Phase 8C**: Accelerating Beep "Hot Potato" Timer System (Catch Phrase-style escalating beeps in final 20s)

**Next Up:**
- Phase 9: Final polish, App Store submission, documentation

## Lessons Learned

- [2025-05-22] When using @testing-library/react, ensure @testing-library/dom is also installed as a dependency to avoid runtime errors.
- [2025-05-22] Use --legacy-peer-deps flag when encountering ESLint version conflicts in npm install.
- [2025-05-22] requestAnimationFrame-based timers are difficult to test with fake timers; focus tests on state management and API contracts rather than timing accuracy.
- [2025-05-22] Web Audio API requires proper TypeScript declarations for webkitAudioContext to support older browsers.
- [2025-05-22] jsdom environment is required for testing React hooks that interact with DOM APIs like AudioContext.
- [2025-05-22] Project has nested structure with React app in `words-on-phone-app/` subdirectory. Always run dev/build commands from the words-on-phone-app directory, not the root. Root package.json is just a stub with minimal scripts.
- [2025-05-22] Lighthouse Performance scores of 78/100 are respectable for React PWAs with complex game logic. Focus on achieving 90+ in Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO as primary success criteria. Performance can be optimized but shouldn't block release for scores above 70.
- [2025-01-27] IndexedDB mocking in tests requires careful implementation of all methods used by the app. Missing methods like `getAll()` in mock objects can cause test timeouts. Sometimes it's better to focus on functional testing over complete unit test coverage when 3rd-party library mocking becomes complex.
- [2025-01-27] Web Audio API AudioContext should use a global singleton pattern to prevent multiple contexts and "closed context" errors. Browser autoplay policies require AudioContext to be resumed on user interaction. Cleanup effects that close contexts should be avoided when the context needs to persist across component re-renders.
