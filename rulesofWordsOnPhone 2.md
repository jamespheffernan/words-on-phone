In WordsOnPhone you’re basically playing verbal hot-potato: teams race to make teammates guess a hidden phrase while a secret countdown ticks; when the buzzer explodes, whichever team is still holding the phone loses that round.  ￼ ￼

⸻

Setup
	1.	Form two teams of roughly even size and sit or stand in an alternating circle so you’re not next to your own teammates.  ￼
	2.	Choose a category (or “Everything”) and a buzzer sound; the app’s library holds 7 000-plus phrases split across ten themed lists.  ￼
	3.	Pick a starting player to hold the phone; that player’s screen will show the first phrase while the timer (30–90 s, hidden) starts automatically.  ￼

⸻

Turn-by-turn play
	1.	Give clues so your own team— and only your team— can shout the exact phrase.
	•	You may talk, gesture, or use synonyms.
	•	You may not say any word in the phrase, spell it, give its first letter, or use rhymes.  ￼
	2.	When your team guesses correctly, tap to reveal the next phrase and immediately hand the phone to the player on the other team to keep the hot-potato moving.  ￼ ￼
	3.	Play continues—guess, tap, pass—until the hidden timer hits zero and the buzzer sounds.  ￼

⸻

End of a round & scoring
	•	If the buzzer sounds while you’re holding the phone, your team loses the round.
	•	The opposing team gains one point; most groups play to 7 points, but you can set any target or just tally wins manually (the app itself doesn’t enforce a score limit).  ￼

Optional settings & house rules

Option in the app	What it changes	Typical house tweak
Timer slider	30 – 90 s hidden countdown	Shorten for higher tension
Category picker	One list or “Everything”	Agree a “skip” penalty for tricky phrases
Buzzer sound	20 quirky SFX	Random “surprise” buzzer for laughs

All other party-game customs—e.g., standing up to pass faster, imposing drink/penalty tasks, or adding gesture-only rounds—are fair game as long as everyone agrees before you start.
